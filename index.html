<p>The first draft is always the hardest. WordFlow is a text editor with accountability. Instead of just telling you how many words you've written, it measures the consistency of your typing, and gives you a score based on your output. It encourages you to keep writing by sharing your consistency with other writers in real-time, and it helps you build good habits by analyzing and keeping track of your day-to-day writing output.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Cheryl Strayed once said that the best advice for writers is, simply, "put butt in chair." Dylan Thomas would write down the first word of a poem, and then celebrate for the rest of the day. Breaking the silence is always the hardest part.

Facing down a blank screen can be daunting. It's too easy for a writer to over-think things, or get another cup of coffee, or go feed the cat — anything but actually write.</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>
  
<p>By focusing on the consistency of the writing instead of the volume, WordFlow encourages writers to start typing, and discourages them from stopping until the time is up. And since users can see one another's output, there's an extra incentive to keep writing.</p>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Just go to impromptu-sunset.herokuapp.com, say how long you want to write, and start typing. If you want to, you can create an account to see how other writers are doing and keep track of your day-to-day output.</p>
